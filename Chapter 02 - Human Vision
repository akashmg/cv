Chapter 02 - Human Vision

Ganglia transmit info to brain
- ~ 1 million of them
- Different ganglia connect to different kinds of photoreceptors, sensitive to different things
- M cells: depth, movementm, orientation/position of objects
- P cells: color, shape, fine details

Visual cortex interprets data
- More than 30 different substructures in the brain for processing visual data
- V1: primary visual cortex
  - Edge detection
  - Highly spatially sensitive
- V2: secondary visual cortex
  - Size, color, shape, possibly memory
  - Sends signals onwward to V3, V4, V5
  - Sends strong feedback back to V1
- Many of these system functions are not well understood
Visual cortex is split (maybe)

Ventral vs dorsal stream
Ventral
- recognition/identification
- High spatial frequencies, details
- Long term stored representations
- Relatively slow
- Typically high consciousness
- Allocentric or object centered
- Mainly foveal or parafoveal
- Generally reasonably small effects

Dorsal
- Visually guided behavior
- High temporal frequencies - motion
- only very short-term storage
- Relatively fast
- Typically low consciousness
- Egocentric or viewer-centered
- Across retina
- Often large effects, eg. motion parallax

What does this split mean?
- Recognition and action are split
- Damage to dorsal system:
  - Can recognize objects
  - Poor visual control for tasks like grasping
- Damage to ventral system
  - Cannot recognize objects
  - Can still manipulate them, grasping, etc,
- Much of the information in the dorsal system is not consciously accesible

Blindsight: vision without sight

One eye
- Focus: how much your lens must change to make object clear
- Blur: objects that are blurry are at different depth
- Parallax: observer or object moves, gets multiple views

Two eyes
- Steropsis: images from eyes are different
- Convergence: where your eyes are pointing

Brain
- Kinetic depth: infer 3d shape of moving objects
- Occlusion: objects in front are closer
- Familiar objects: you know how big a car is...
- Shading: 3d shape from light/shadow cues

Operate on sRGB
 - Typically ~ .3R + .59G + .11B
